# Quaternion Graphics in Python
Research project advised by [Dr. William Pezzaglia](https://people.well.com/user/billium/) at Las Positas Community College during the 2020-2021 school year. The project includes a basic implementation of [Quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) in Python. Using the [vpython](https://vpython.org/) library to display 3D graphics, we use our Quaternions implementation to computer and display arbitrary rotations in the 3D space.
